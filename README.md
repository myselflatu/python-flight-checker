# Python Flight Checker

Python Flight Checker is a Python script that allows users to check the status of any flight. It makes use of the aviationstack API to fetch real-time flight data such as departure/arrival times, flight duration, aircraft type, and more.


The script requires the user to input the flight details such as flight number and departure date. It then sends an API request to the aviationstack endpoint and returns the flight data in a readable format.
